=head1 NAME

wordle - Perl homage to the world game (https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/)

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ wordle
    Enter your guess: arise
    ...

=head1 HOW TO PLAY

You have six tries to guess a five-letter word. For every guess, if you have a
correct letter in the correct position, it will show up as bright green on black.

If you have a correct letter in the wrong position, it will show up as bright
red on black.

If you have an incorrect letter, it will show up as bright white on black.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

This does not run properly on Windows (due to the color codes).

The wordlist can be found in C<App::Wordle::Words::EN_US> and is somewhat
limited.  I tried using a standard wordlist from C</usr/dict/words>, but it
had too many words that I've never heard of, making the game unreasonably
hard. I've chosen a simpler word list, but it's missing many common words.

=head1 DISCLAIMER

There appears to be no copyright on Wordle, or restrictions on its usage. The
name of this package may change if that turns out to not be the case.
